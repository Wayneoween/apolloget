apolloget - a script for downloaing images from the NASA Archive
====================

## Why

One day I found out about [NASA's Apollo Archive](http://www.apolloarchive.com/)
and due to my general interest in space and the ISS I was excited to click
through them.

But I cheered too soon because this archive is in no way actually usable.

First of all there are frames used. No one should be allowed to use frames
anymore. Then you are allowed to receive an image only every two seconds.

When [PetaPixel](http://petapixel.com/2013/07/21/check-out-these-hi-res-hasselblad-film-scans-from-every-single-apollo-mission/)
linked to the site, they even __closed down__ for a week due to
**"high traffic"**.

## Problems

As I mentioned before there is a serverside barrier that allows new images to
be downloaded only every two seconds. I haven't come around to adress this yet.
This is a problem on two fronts since I need to get the image deeplink first
(this is where the frames are the problem) and after that I can download it.
So its **fucking SLOW**
